# Report for Group Assignment 1.3

*[CEGM1000 MUDE](http://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/): Week 1.3, Friday, Sep 20, 2024.*

_Remember to read the grading and submission instructions in the `README.md` file thoroughly before finalizing your answers in this document!_

## Questions

**Question 1**

Give a short explanation about the data and the models we created. Include brief statements about the data, including an explanation of the groundwater interpolation step and why it was necessary.

_Your answer should only be a few sentences long, and be sure to use quantitative information! You do not need to reproduce the model, but it would be useful to do things like confirm the number of models, model parameters, observations, etc. You can use bullet lists to summarize and state interesting information._

_We copy the LaTeX equation for the model here, in case you would like to refer to it in your Report._

$$
d = d_0 + vt + k \ \textrm{GW},
$$



**Question 2**

Two types of confidence intervals are used in this assignment. Describe what the confidence intervals are and mention specifically the type of information that is included in the algorithm to calculate them. Make observations about the CI's for each model. Explain why, even though the $\alpha$ value is small (i.e., the CI is close to 100%), in the time series plots many of the data are _not_ contained within the CI, whereas they _are_ contained within the CI for the residual plots.

_Hint: Are the intervals uniform for the entire time series? Which uncertainties are propagated into each type of CI?_


_Write your answer here._

**Question 3**

Do you see any systematic effects in the residuals for each model? Make a few relevant observations about the residuals. Give your interpretation for any discrepancy between observations and the model.

_It may be useful to include qualitative and quantitative observations about the residuals, for example, the histogram/PDF comparison and the moments of the residuals._

_Write your answer here._

**Question 4**

Compare the results you found for the InSAR observations and the GNSS observations. Discuss the differences between the results. Be quantitative!


_Write your answer here._

**Last Question: How did things go? (Optional)**

_Use this space to let us know if you ran into any challenges while working on this GA, and if you have any feedback to report._
